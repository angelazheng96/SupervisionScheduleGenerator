# SupervisionScheduleGenerator

This repository contains the code for our project for ICS4U (Computer Science), completed in March 2024 with [Jessica Tao](https://github.com/jetao7) and Kiki Awe.

The Supervision Schedule Generator is programmed using Google Apps Script to add functionality to a spreadsheet database, which generates teachers' supervision schedules for the entire semester. The Google Sheet has automatic sorting, formatting, and searching, allowing teachers to easily reference their assigned shifts. The scheduling feature takes into account holidays, teachers' schedules, and preferences, ensuring that all teachers are assigned an equivalent amount of shifts.
